# Options Concepts

Here's my notes from working through chapter 1.

What is an option?
  - options contract: derives its value from an underlying asset
  - can be used to hedge against large variations (e.g. delta hedging)
  - can also be used for speculation

## Basic definitions

  | underlying        |  asset whose price is the base of the option      |
  | strike price      |  buy/sell price of underlying on the option       |
  | expiration        |  last date of the option                          |

  | out of the money  |  options over (call) or under (put) current price |

Still needs a bit of digesting, but it's my summary of the summary in the book.
