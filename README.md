# Options and Derivatives Programming in C++

Author: Carlos Oliveira
ISBN: 978-1-4842-1813-6

Another book-based repo. This time a little bit of a C++ refresher as well as a
glimpse into what the algorithmic trading world is like.

Code examples have been tested on Mac OS X using XCode 7, but any compiler that
implements the C++11 standard should do fine according to the author.

[MinGW][mingw] is an option on Windows, or there is [gcc][gcc] which I'm using.

Oliveira makes the code available on [his website][coli].
